### ``programming is my outlet of creativity``

**Hello, I’m Daniel (26, 🇩🇪) and currently studying Computer Science at the Technical University Darmstadt 👋**

I started learning programming at the young age of 9 years, and ever since, writing software has been my passion and favorite hobby. Sinking countless hours into a million pet projects over many years just for fun. Computer Science and Programming are like a never-ending playground of new and exciting stuff to explore and learn.

There is always a new language to try, a new paradigm to learn, a new technology to explore, and problems that need a simple solution… and from each new input, however unconnected they might be, there is always a possibility to learn something that will later on help in writing simpler and ultimately better code.

### I'm interested in
- 📡 Backend (go) and everything network related 
- 🖌️ Frontend (react, vue, mithril, much more...)
- :computer: System Programming (C++ & C)
- 🦠 Evolutionary Algorithms & Metaheuristics
- 🔬 Reverse Engineering (IA-32, x64)

and much more...

### At my current job I do a wild combination of
- Write code for microcontrollers like **ESP32** and **ARM** based chips in **C** / **C++**
- Build backends in **go**
- Build desktop software with the help of web-technology like **electron**, **react**, **vue**, **mithril**...
