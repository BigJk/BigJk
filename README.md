### ``programming is my outlet of creativity``

**Hello, I'm Daniel (25, :de:) and currently studying Computer Science 👋**

I started learning programming at a young age of 9 years and ever since writing software has been my passion and favorite hobby. Sinking countless hours into a million pet projects over many years just for fun. For me, Computer Science and Programming is like a never ending playground of new and exciting stuff to explore and learn.

There is always a new language to try, a new paradigm to learn, a new technology to explore, problems that need a simple solution... and from each new input, however unconnected they might be there is always a possibility to learn something that will later on help in writing simpler and ultimately better code.

### I'm interested in
- 📡 Backend (go) and everything network related 
- 🖌️ Frontend (react, vue, mithril, much more...)
- :computer: System Programming (C++ & C)
- 🦠 Evolutionary Algorithms & Metaheuristics
- 🔬 Reverse Engineering (IA-32, x64)

and much more...

### At my current job I do a wild combination of
- Write code for microcontrollers like **ESP32** and **ARM** based chips in **C** / **C++**
- Build backends in **go**
- Build desktop software with the help of web-technology like **electron**, **react**, **vue**...
