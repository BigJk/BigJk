- **Hello, I’m Daniel (26, 🇩🇪) 👋**
- **I studied Computer Science at the Technical University Darmstadt**
- **I love solving complex problems with simple code**
- **Programming is not just my job, but my favorite hobby**

I started learning programming at the young age of 9 years, and ever since, writing software has been my passion and favorite hobby. Sinking countless hours into a million pet projects over many years just for fun. Computer Science and Programming are like a never-ending playground of new and exciting stuff to explore and learn.

There is always a new language to try, a new paradigm to learn, a new technology to explore, and problems that need a simple solution… and from each new input, however unconnected they might be, there is always a possibility to learn something that will later on help in writing simpler and ultimately better code.
